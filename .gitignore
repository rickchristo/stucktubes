# This .gitignore is based on the .gitignores provided at github/gitignore
# public repo with some minor customizations.  At the very end is the Octocat's
# .gitignore which is included for good measure.  This also has a handful of
# project-specific ignore rules, which are listed first.  I realize some
# entries are redundant, but I'm not worried about it.
